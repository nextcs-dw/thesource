In this repository you will find a processing program called lightningTimed.pde. It includes new processing features we have not yet discussed. Your mission is to join your TableBuddyâ„¢ and understand the code by filling out this document, reading the questions and filling in the prompts when asked.

### Task 0
* Read the entire program (do not run it yet), make note of anything you have not seen or used before in class. 
* Copy and paste any line of code containing a new function/vairable, langauge feature below. (you may have seen these outside of class if you've done extra research into processing, if that is the case, still include them here).
