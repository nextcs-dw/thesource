Question 0:
Write a function that draws a circle in the middle of the screen. The size and color should be parameters.

=======================
Question 1:
e made an error on the code. Here is this code:

void setup(){
size(300,300);
background(0);
fill(255);

if (x == 10) {
    rect(100, 100, 100, 100);
}
}

What is wrong with the code from slow Joe?

A) He made a typo and put two equal signs.
B) He has empty parenthesis after "void setup".
C) He only has one number after background.
D) He did not declare the variable "x" before he used it.

Correct Answer: D

Question 4:
Write a function that:
Draws a circle of a diameter greater than or equal to 200 and less than 450 at a random coordinate
Decreases in size by 0.8 every half-second
Dissapears when the circle's diameter is less than 10
Given:
int x, y;//position of circle
float size;//diameter of circle

void setup() {
  size(600,600);
  frameRate(30);
  background(255);
  size = random(200,450);
  x  = int(random(size/2, width-(size/2)));
  y = int(random(size/2, height-(size/2)));
}

Question 6:
Alice wrote a code to draw a circle in the middle of the screen, but processing returns an error message. What is wrong with this function?

void setup() {
    size (500, 500);
    double x = 500;
    double y = 500;
    background(0);
    color(255);
    circle(x/2, y/2, 100);
}
